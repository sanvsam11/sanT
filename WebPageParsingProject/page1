             <br> 
             <i><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><font size="5">I am writing my own experiences, which started last year. It is mixture of incest and gay. But its true. I am 20 years old with 6.0 height now I am doing BBA good looking whitish in color, humorous and I was not keen in sex. I was more concerned about my career. My English is poor as my education till matriculation was in Kannada medium so kindly bear with me. </font></font></font><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><font size="5">It starts from marriage of my elder sister Preethi. My sister got married to Prashant very handsome and rich person. They have good business at Hubli. Within few months of my didis marriage, her father in law passed away due to massive heart attack. So, my jiju became alone to handle his vast business and he found it too difficult to handle it alone. He came with proposition to take me with them as we were in some town nearby, where there was no business management college in my town. I wanted to pursue BBA, so my father agreed to this after didi pursued and assured my parents that I would be assisting in their business while studying there itself and we would be mutually benefited, so it would avoid me being in hostel. So, I settled with them. Aunt Malathi thats mother in law of my sister, younger sister of jiju Prema who was a younger to me were there in the house. There were three rooms in a row, one was used by parents, and now only aunt Malathi lived next room was allotted to me, which was previously used by Prema at another end jiju and sister room. All rooms were interconnected, between my room and aunts room there was bathroom, which both had to share. My room was lavishly decorated with all the cozy furniture and was bigger than the room now allotted to Prema for which Prema was un happy but she had accept this as I was the guest and I had come to help them. Prema is of introvert nature she didnt mix up with me. Jiju is very nice person. Aunty still had not recovered from early demise of her hubby. </font></font></font></font></i>
             <br> 
             <font color="blue"><font color="blue"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><i>I started going to attend their business and I am fast learning, so in very short period I adjusted myself with their business. Usually aunt didnt come out of her room most of the time crying or sitting alone with sad face in her room. Once, didi advised me to spare some time for aunty and to bring her out of her sorrow. Now I took more care of aunty and started involving in conversation with her. Even I started entering into her room of course with her consent. Her mood started changing, initially she used to just nod or say yes or no type short answers but I was reluctant to speak with her and she could not escape from my company. Somehow, I was successful to bring her out to sitting room and sometimes I would suggest or insist to watch some good programs from TV. After some days, she came to speaking terms with me and started enquiring about business and casual matters. Now very often I would take all females to temple and even sat sang. Prema and sister used to be busy in their own work, now a days I started taking out aunt only and she started enjoying my company. I think to some extent that I was able to take her out of her shell. By now, my vacation was over and I had taken admission to business school. I had college in mornings only. So, I had ample of free time. <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> </i></font></font></font></font>
             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>Things were going pretty well, but on one Saturday while returning from the Hanuman and Shani temple aunt asked me take her to some park, where there is no rush. I was stunned because this was the first time she chose place other than temples or shopping. When we entered park we found a secluded place and no one was nearby. I looked at her she was looking ground and my trying for words to start. I asked her the reason she mumbled first and then said if u doesnt mind I can say something, which you have to keep secret. I assured her. See its family problem I dont know whether I should be discussing it with you or not, at least I can reduce my burden of carrying it. </i></font></font></font>
             <br> 
             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>Now a day I feel that your sister is not as happy as she was. It was news for me, I had never observed such a thing from my sister, or she deliberately managed not to express herself. I asked how you say, only a woman can understand another woman. </i></font></font></font>
             <br> 
             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>ME - in what sense she is un happy because she has most handsome hubby, she got all luxuries here which even she had never dreamt of she has car, bungalow, wealth, jewellery and above all such a caring mother in law, who is more than like mother to her. As far as my knowledge goes, the problem generally starts by another woman itself. Either it may be her mother-in-law or sister-in-law here there are no chances. You are more than mother and daughter, because when you were feeling lonely, she was the first to instruct me to take you out somewhere and bring you out of the shell. So that you have to, again become cheerful and be a part in regular life. In addition, I think you are now. </i></font></font></font>

             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>AUNTY- what u said is partially correct what your sister got after coming over here is ok but for what she is entitled and suppose if she does not get hats more important and we should see that she gets it. </i></font></font></font>

             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>ME- (I got the point but not clearly) see jiju is a muscular and strong man and he is very sober what problem can be with him. </i></font></font></font>
             <br> 
             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>AUNT- thats what I was under same impression but the things are not as we see them. There must be something wrong with my son. After a pause she continued initially he was not ready for marriage every time we proposed he used postpone on one or other pretext. On persuasion by me and my hubby, finally he agreed that too on threatening him. We never came to know what the problem was we never tried to diagnose the real problem. We went on insisting not understanding. That is where we went wrong. Aunty started crying I wanted to console her but decided against and waited for her to cool, again she continued see when he was opposing for marriage either he was in love with someone or he has physical problem. I dont know what the exact problem is, but surely there is some problem initial days after marriage I think everything was going smoothly but of late his behaviors are not proper this I can say only on looking bahu. I think by going against his wish we scapegoat your sister. Somehow, you try to find out the problem and solve it if you cant tell me the problem we shall try to find solution. I am giving such a big responsibility to such young child please forgive me for bothering you. Suppose if you are successful, I will the happiest person on the earth, thus you can save your sister my family and our reputation saying this she lost all her control started crying heavily and laid her on my shoulder, and she was almost hugging. For the first time I felt bosoms on by body but both of us ignored that we are male and female but we were seriously engrossed in our own thoughts. Even I was weeping silently. Now I tried to console her but she took her own time to cool-off. Once she was ok, we normal we washed our face in tap water and headed for house and we did not exchange any words, before she got off the bike I assured her again promised that I will do my best. <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> </i></font></font></font>

             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>When we reached home we were silent I got into my room and sprawled on the bed and started thinking what aunty told whether he has any relation with outsider, he hardly goes out other than shop from shop he never stops in between to house except any shopping he hardly that also, either servants or we people do it. Then the only chance he has is when he is out of station that too mainly Bangalore where he goes frequently, and every time he is eager to go or is he impotent. If he got married any one early or had relation with anyone there, what to do? If yes, I should find her out. And suppose if he is impotent then lot of medicines are available and we can see what we can only after knowing exact problem. Thinking this I don&#x2019;t know when I dosed off. Sis awakened me for food, somehow I managed to eat, but aunty didn&#x2019;t come out of her room. Days were passing and I was watching my jiju and sister on close observation I too felt like sister was not as charming as charming as she was before, her many of smiles felt artificial sometimes even her talks. I never observed jiju eyeing any girl where I used to see girls just out of curiously but at least casually. Whereas jiju did not even, like that also. I was waiting for him to go for purchasing so that I wanted to fallow him in pretext of learning purchasing. When I found jiju looking for stocks inventory I felt that in couple of days he may leave I informed aunty that jiju is going Bangalore and I want go along with him. Aunty said fine idea and I myself would ask him to take you along with him and teach you and can stay one day extra and go for sightseeing. As planned aunty sent me along with jiju, but this trip was utter failure as we came back the next day by noon by intercity train, jiju had no possibility of meeting anybody other business, jiju said he is not feeling well and we rushed back. But within a week, he planned again this time it was essential, as we had not completed purchases so again same trick was played by aunty. Somehow, we went and started purchases somehow I was not satisfied the way he did as most of the times they said rates as usual we made payment and placed order and left absolutely there was no bargaining. As if our visit was to make payment and I felt that jiju was in hurry to finish of the deals and wanted to spare his time for something else. I was reluctant to follow him though he said we had to move lot of places and it would be tiresome to roam around the city. And promised if I take rest in lodge, he will pick me up in the evening and will take me to some places and some enjoyment. My purpose of visit was specific so I didn&#x2019;t yield to his words and argued that if I am with his business sooner or later I have come alone for the purpose and need to learn the art of buying to make contacts with our dealers, thus I never gave him any privacy. So, minute by minute, he was getting frustrated, but he never came to knew that I was doing this deliberately. Somehow, two days passed but evenings he took me to some of the places worth seeing that including M.G road discotheque where he met couple of his male friends, he introduced me to them. On third day, he again tried to avoid me but was in vain. Till night, we went on seeing dealers or some other places. But night he was totally frustrated, he was not in a position to show it but I could guess by his gestures. Again in the night he said, he is going to meet some his buddy but I was not ready to leave him alone. I was following him like VIKRAM AND BETHAL (ghost, a story from Panchatantra). That worked really he called his friends over the phone and pretended as if they are busy or out of station. At last, he asked me whether I take drinks, I said I don&#x2019;t drink but if you are interested you can go ahead and have whatever you want. Jiju decided to go a dance bar and I accompanied him there he took few drinks and I was enjoying the dances. Again, two of his friends met and jiju introduced me as his brother-in-law so within few minutes they left. About his friends, I felt very strange about them when they had come to our table one sat my side and another beside jiju. The one sitting near me had placed his hand on my thigh I was astonished the one, who knows hardly keeps his hand on my thigh and tries to massage my thigh, and their dress and body language was very different. I held they might be GAY. After three four drinks jiju said, shall we move? I said ok though I was enjoying semi nude dancers. But I got up along with him and we headed to some restaurant, which was very nice and had good dinner. While going to room jiju said shall we take some drinks to room, I said ok and as u please. But he insisted to give company so at last thinking that let me booze him to his throat and shall try to open him up. So, I asked him to buy beer, as I don&#x2019;t drink hot beer also very rare. We collected bottles, once inside room, slowly he opened his scotch, and me my beer and I encouraged him to have more and more, as he felt kick we started talking on various matters. He was losing his balance now somehow the topic came to sex. Now I played a trick and enquired him whether the friends we met at dance bar were GAY jiju was astonished to hear my comment. <br> HE-how do you say <br> ME -he was caressing my thigh. <br> HE- bloody rascal he muttered to himself whenever he finds young boys he tries to seduce them but the speech was almost audible and I sensed something is fishy hear and I continued with small hint that he was fondling my penis (a white lie just to pull his leg) is it? Bastard he said this was loud enough. The other day who had met at the discotheque also seemed me same. Now jiju asked me how do judge, I can sense by their gestures. Now jiju was becoming cool. Jiju asked me whether you have any experience. Now jiju shifted to my side of the coach where I was sitting and had another stiff shot of drinks and forced me to take some more beer as I was going very slowly. Again he asked me have experienced gay activities, I said no. Then how come you know about it. Few of my friends are at it. And by chance, I have seen couple of gay DVDs. He again asked have enjoyed at least girls. However, I had no such experience, I was not that interested in sex, and I was more concerned about carrier building than wasting time on such things. But wanted to continue I said. Not completely but I have kissed couple of girls and fondled their boobs. How did you felt and why did not complete the course. Girls did not cooperate for further and circumstance was nit favorable. Now he kept his hand on my thigh. And continue to talk. Suddenly I asked a direct question just to trap him while he was boozed enough. What is the difference you felt in gay and straight, as you have experienced bisexuals. This trick paid the biggest dividend and without thinking for what I was asking or realizing under influence of alcohol he opened his mouth. I like more of gay than straight and particularly, being banged (now he realized what he committed but damage was already done). <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> </i></font></font></font>

             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>Suddenly he became silent and emptied the glass he held. He wanted to close the chapter but I was not ready but for me also it was very hard to digest the fact that my own juju is a gay. But I wanted to take more information, so I asked him how you entered into gay circle he was silent and avoiding the subject shall we sleep it&#x2019;s already late and on persistence, he opened his mouth. It all started when I was in residential school my seniors were after me as was one of most attractive among the lot, then they seduced my with all their tricks and somehow I submitted to them and thus the my gay life started and still continued, at last he confessed. Even today, I came here to get my bunghole screwed. <br> ME-why all the way here, there must be many cocks in your hometown? <br> HE- See. It&#x2019;s question of prestige I can&#x2019;t go and ask someone to screw me, I need to maintain secrecy, and family prestige is more imp. I have thought about it hundred times either to leave this habit or look there someone but looking into pros and cons, I left the idea. Here I have some good old friends of mine who are very clean and healthy, they too not indulge into others than our own company. We are worried of the diseases. Then how about the your wife I asked JIJU-see if I get what I want I will be able to perform in house better or I can&#x2019;t get it up at all. This was another shock for me. So, all of a sudden he touched my cock before I could know his hand entered in my bermuda and directly he hold my cock. I was astonished by his act. <br> ME- what is this why you are touching like this are you over drunk and leave me alone. Now all of a sudden he started crying I can&#x2019;t live without cock, in last visit, also you did not allow me to go anywhere, and this time you are torturing me, what else can do now and started screaming hysterically. Now in return I had cooled him. At last, he said if you become my partner I shall be the luckiest person. But how I have never liked this kind of act, and I can&#x2019;t be a part in this. See if provide me your cock I need not come here, there itself if I can have it will be fantastic he replied between the sobs. It may be for you but what about sister, have you thought about it, I was not sure about my so I had requested my parents but they were bent upon my marriage. At least I performed for few months but I could satisfy neither my wife nor myself. Then I noticed at myself still he was holding my penis and by his mere touch it had grown it its fullest because it was the first time anybody holding me other than myself. I used to masturbate occasionally or else I touched while bathing. He followed my eyes to my lund and exclaimed beautiful and he asked himself loudly. Then he again urged me to fuck him, I was feeling some funny sensation and I started liking his touch. When he tried to remove my bermuda, I opposed and said no. I don&#x2019;t want to be gay like you and in future, I don&#x2019;t want to trouble my wife like my sis. He assured me things won&#x2019;t be like that because I was used as scapegoat by my seniors but u will be loved and I was always molested by them where as u won&#x2019;t. I will not going to force you to be fucked but you had to fuck me periodically and I will never force you to be fucked. No was my answer again. At last, he played a trick whether you want your sister to be happy or not, if yes then follow my instruction and if no it&#x2019;s your sister and your fate. Actually, I was ready to do anything for pleasure and life of my sis. If you keep me satisfied, I will see that your sister and you will be happy ever after. If you desire you can be my 50% partner in my business. And if you wish, I can provide any beautiful girl you want you can ask for cine artist also I can bring them with my contacts. But please don&#x2019;t say no and fuck me. <br> ME-look I am not interested in what you are offering me partnership and your property, but what I want is happiness of my sis. If she is ok, every condition is acceptable by me, but only one request is that you should not indulge with others because I don&#x2019;t want to risk anybody&#x2019;s life, suppose if you catch any disease it will be transferred to both of us. He readily agreed for this and before I could say anything, he removed my bermuda, poked his ass towards me, stood up, and placed my lund on his pecker as if I was mesmerized. Maybe he took some body-lotion, smeared his ass hole, and plunged his back positioning my cock and my head slid-in nicely. And another thrust by him may be half of my lund entered in. He paused for a moment and pushed himself slowly. His expert ass gulped me completely. Now he instructed me to hold his shoulder and start pumping. It felt nice and warm inside him, because I had never felt anything other than my rough hand but this was something different. While I was pushing forward, he cooperated by backstrokes. I don&#x2019;t know how long I maintained the pace but I came to end as it was my first time and I started ramming and with the last stroke I emptied my balls and fell on bed after pulling myself out. He said thank you and lay beside me after breathing came to normal he asked was it your really first time I don&#x2019;t believe, you performed so well. When I confirmed that, it was first he congratulated for losing my virginity. But I felt I lost my silly-busy and that too so unceremoniously. <br> After some rest he again put his on my pecker and massaged it oh my god it&#x2019;s getting life mere touch what a shameless it is, when it was halfway he started licking it and within no time it was hard like steel. Still I was lying on my back closing my eyes, when I felt tight grip I opened my eyes and found him straddling on me and descending himself on my hard cock he was facing me he slowly engulfed me totally and started pumping himself slowly and within few minutes he picked up the pace. I saw his face how handsome he is my sister is really lucky to have such a handsome man as her hubby except for this problem, as he was raising and falling on me now I saw his lund it had erected like a electric pole and was longer than mine and even thicker also. I could not keep my mouth shut and commented on his pecker, jiju you have bigger than me. It looks nice. He said surely mine is very nice and stability is very high. I can satisfy any woman with pole of mine but what to do I am not that interested in woman. But I have serviced your sister nicely but off late, again this problem of being screwed is disturbing me. But don&#x2019;t worry, I will be good partner for sister and brother. Can you fondle mine and please masturbate me so that I can have both pleasure at a time he requested. I could not say no after all was asking a favour and subconsciously took him in my palm and started stroking him. Again, it was my first time holding others cock, but I was not dejected and went on stroking. I don&#x2019;t know how long he pumped but surely it took very long but I should appreciate his muscle strength may be even after some 30 minutes still he was jumping on me. After some time, I said jiju pump fast. I am about to come, he did so and asked me to pump faster so that he too can ejaculate. Though my hand was aching, I increased speed. After couple of minutes, we discharged simultaneously. My cum was spurting inside his tight canal and his first spurt went high and landed beyond my head and on my face and remaining on my chest and lastly on my belly. He must have shot at least a cup I thought he collapsed on me and started licking his own cum from face, chest, and remaining he scooped with his fingers and swallowed all. When my dick slowly shrunken and came out of his bum. Jiju rolled off me, said boy you has got real capacity, and your cock is best for your age and it&#x2019;s going to grow to massive one two or three years and you may overtake me. I was happy to hear it and drifted into sleep forgetting I was being emotionally blackmailed or wanted to help both jiju and sister. In the morning, I opened my eyes with wetness in my loins. Then I saw jiju is licking my morning stiffness. Oh my god, are you not satisfied yet. He smiled with a grin and continued. When it was ready for war, he left me and kneeled before me and I automatically lined up with his poker and started sinking in him. And went on ramming him this time I enjoyed little by ramming him. Yesterday I had behaved like slave doing his duty. I must have fucked him at least for half an hour in between I managed to play with his dick even without his invitation to fondle which he too enjoyed. This time he exploded before me and after, say about five minutes, I pumped him with the speed I was worth and filled his tight ass. And remain inside, till my balls emptied and waited to my penis shrink to come out by itself. When cock came out, he turned and embraced me and said it was one of the most memorable to him. Afterwards, we brushed teeth, had tea, and were ready for bath. While bathing, I had not locked the door because there was nothing to hide. Meanwhile jiju also entered in bathroom, took the soap, and gave me a nice bath. Washed my genital thoroughly, gave a kiss to it, and tried to swallow it. but I said enough for now. He did not mind and in turn, I gave him bath. Rubbed his whole body and after bath, we had breakfast and went on final round of purchasing. Today jiju was very happy, as his lust had fulfilled. By evening, we were back to hotel he casually enquired whether to stay one more day. I said no! we have left shop on servants, it is not a good to rely to this extent. He said so we will have one more round I accepted gladly and said let me freshen up before we start I went and took bath I felt totally fresh after me he took bath and came out totally nude. His long pecker was hanging like a dead snake. The moment he came near me, he took my robe, made me nude, and started licking whole body. He kissed me everywhere and came to kiss my lips, but I didn&#x2019;t like it, he understood and left my lips but surely kissed my cheeks. By now, I was ready to ride him. This time I took him to dressing table, laid him on back, and raised his legs, took them on my shoulder and he guided my rod to his brim. And I started inserting the tool slowly, started fucking him in slow pace. Here I felt something is missing and later understood what I was expecting. Nice boobs to squeeze while fucking any way, he was man and did not posses breast, but the fucking was very nice. And I fucked him till my cock was sore. He was holding my bums for his support. After fucking for about 45 minutes, I discharged in ass and took out my cock. It came out with a sound like opening a cork of a bottle and I collapsed on the nearby bed. And took enough rest after strenuous marathon. Now he too got up lazily and we cleaned ourselves, started packing, and headed for station after sumptuous food to station by now his agent had arranged for tickets for first ac and reached Hubli next day early morning. <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://srv.xossip.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br> </i></font></font></font>

             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>While at Bangalore, my life almost changed in 24 hours and I felt like a mature man after coming back the normal life began and I was observing sister keenly. I felt there is some change in her she looked more lively than previous and sometimes I overheard some sound as their room was beside mine. May be they were making love. Jiju was also happy but he never mentioned about his night activities but I could guess. After a week&#x2019;s time he looked bit tensed and he asked me company I could understand what it is. Then I asked about the place, he said that I am also thinking about it. I will arrange something in two days he said, he had many properties across the city. He vacated one of the small room in the far end of the city, he took me there in the evening it was furnished with a cozy bed cot and table and four chairs. The moment we entered, he jumped on me like an animal and started kissing me everywhere and within no time, we were nude and started our business. We had two rounds in two hours and went home, for few days it went on smoothly. In between, aunty complimented me. And she told that there is difference on her bahu&#x2019;s face. She enquired me what was there at Bangalore but I could not answer her properly but hinted that he had some problem, but is solved partially and I will tell details when time come. When my sister and me were alone even sister asked me what happened at Bangalore, I asked why, she said after coming there is some change IN PRAHSANTH. I asked what type, she was hesitant and did not directly nut said he looks like he is more comfortable now, and looks like happy person. Are you happy about it Preethi said surely that&#x2019;s the reason I am asking. Then don&#x2019;t worry much and be happy. It went as it is for three months and once Preethi asked me the reason for coming late after closing the shop, sometimes we used to skip in business hours only. That&#x2019;s also problematic. One day when we were alone aunty had gone out and Prema to college Preethi asked me the reason for coming late and what is going on and she had come to know about skipping during business hours, through office staff. I was in soup, somehow I wanted to manage, but she asked whether we are visiting prostitutes. Answering her was new problem but she was reluctant to have answer, saying cooked up stories but she believed none and she said aunty is also tensed about it, aunty had also enquired about late coming coolly but had not made it a big issue. Preethi finally asked me are you not happy I am live peacefully. If yes then why are you hiding things from me? Finally, she warned me that she is going to tell pappa about it, as this is happening only after my arrival only previously Prashant was home on right time. We heard footsteps of aunty and kept quite. Very next day itself Preethi called me from shop in the afternoon on some pretext, when I was home she was alone and, aunty had been to some function with neighbors, was next expected till night. I was in trouble, I had to say something, she pressurized so much, and even she threatened me of suicide. At last I opened my mouth, warned her if you are brave enough to listen the fact and if you don&#x2019;t blame me for any act. She assured me and I told everything from aunty s request to present day. I even gave almost account of encounters I had with jiju. When I finished she broke into tears, which was lead to earthshaking crying. She embraced me but still weeping. I was trying my best to console her, but in vain. After few attempts, I let her till her content and I was combing her hairs by my fingers and with another hand holding her tight. When I turned a little to comfort her now we were embracing straight her boobs were on my chest, they were strong within some time I had different sensation, which I had never felt particularly about my sis. This was new for me Even I had fucked jiju and enjoyed it but breast feeling was different and while fucking jiju I was missing boobs so now they were there pressing my chest. I wanted to feel them with my Hands but as she is my sister I did not dare to touch them with my palms, I was trying to control myself not touch. They are the most beautiful breasts in the word (they were 34 b, which learned later). I don&#x2019;t know how long we were in the tight embrace, and I loved every minute Of it. Now I tried my level best to console her and I promised her we would stop the relation from this moment itself if she does not find it correct. May be after 20 minutes she became calm. When she left me, I went to make coffee and I asked her to get up and freshen up. By the time coffee was ready she was bit recovered and without exchanging any words, we had coffee and I left for shop. Since then I avoided jiju&#x2019;s relation whenever he invited I postponed with some or another pretext. Within two weeks time jiju was getting frustrated I could watch through his behavior but I was helpless. Once jiju called and he wanted to know the reason I explained everything, so he was quite and did not comment anything but he too was thinking a lot about it. After some days when didi felt his rejuvenation is gone, and he was not per forming sex with her, didi came to seriousness of his problem. Once didi called me and wanted to talk something, she was very hesitant in first but finally she came beside me, hid her face on my shoulder, and started conversation slowly. She asked since when we have not done, <br> ME &#x2013; what<br> SHE- what you are doing? <br> ME &#x2013; doing? what? <br> DIDI &#x2013; what you and jiju used to do? <br> ME - business.<br> DIDI- at last she said, since when you and jiju did not have sex. <br> ME &#x2013; oh sex, I stopped the Very moment you asked me to stop and I will never do it. <br> DIDI - no I did not asked you to stop<br> But I was very upset to know the truth. <br> ME- ok whatever it is but I have decided never to repeat It. <br> DIDI- no you can do it. <br> ME - no, I am not interested in homosexual acts but as jiju had assured that if I fuck him, in turn he is going to fuck you and will keep you satisfied. By these dirty words didi was astonished and said how filthy language you are using you are totally spoiled. I said I am not but those were words jiju actually said and I repeated his exact statement, in fact, I did not like rigging him and even I was worried, as I should not become homo by doing it with him. But just to see you happy and contended I agreed for it. Otherwise, I would have quit your house and your business. I wanted to shift to hostel and forget the whole episode. But only looking at you and your family reputation, I wanted to protect jiju from the clutch of his bastard friends. And I know that he is giving some big amounts to keep himself satisfied and keep the relation secret, which was making us loose so many things. Almost every week he wanted to visit Bangalore so he lost the track of business he had to rely on his staff, where there are misappropriations and loose so much of cash, he was so desperate to have my lund that he even offered partnership in the business to extent of 50%. So, I decided if I did not cooperate then the loss could increase to any extent. And suppose if he finds a wrong person, he will spoil everything and even he can blackmail and loot us to any extent or even he can spread the disease if he had any, which in turn ruin you. Thinking all this only I agreed, and I have contacted a hostel and thinking of leaving house very shortly. By hearing my decision my sister was really startled and said not to leave them alone, I have also thought regarding this, and the reason I wanted to speak this only. You can continue your relation with him let him be partner for both my brother and me but on single condition that don&#x2019;t go anywhere else but do it in house. I was startled to hear it she continued that&#x2019;s the only solution, suppose if you leave him, it will add to problems than solving. So, it&#x2019;s my earnest request that please do continue and don&#x2019;t leave us dry and high. <br> ME - how we can do such a thing. That too, when, everybody is in the house. Sorry didi, I can&#x2019;t do anything in presence of you. <br> DIDI - see it does not mean that you have done it in front of me but in either your room or in our room, till you are done, I will be outside. <br> ME &#x2013; let me see, give me some time and I will think about it and tell. <br> she requested me the answer is +ve. Next day jiju explained me what the discussion took between husband and wife, in fact he was very happy that his wife not only approved hi gay mentality but also in the house and that too with her own brother, few days back it was just unimaginable but things were changing. <img src="/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Love" class="inlineimg"> <img src="/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt="" title="happy" class="inlineimg"> <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smile" class="inlineimg"> <br> </i></font></font></font>

             <font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="5"><font color="blue"><i>Somehow, I could not deny request of both, we started fucking generally in my room and even some time in sister room, and it was very often we mated discreetly. Neither Prema or aunty was aware of it. May be after months time she came and said discretely, do you make it very hard? <br> ME  why do you ask. By the time he is back to the room he is tired really though he is willing to enjoy with me, he cant and avoids though he has got very good erection. This time I really got wild and shouted at her see if I do slow or short he is not satisfied and if I fuck him as per his taste, you are complaining. I am really fed up between both of you. For god s sake, please leave me alone, and without waiting for any answer I went out, and came very late after second show picture. All were worried really as mobile was also switched off. In cine hall, also, I was thinking how to get rid-off the situation, still I couldnt make any decision. It was too much of a burden for my age. Days were passing I was irregular with jiju one day jiju proposed me still worst thing. He wanted me to fuck him while he was fucking my sister at a time he wanted to enjoy being fucked while he was fucking another, still I couldnt make out what he wanted as was strong enough had muscular body could sustain lot of stress and strain. He said dont be embarrassed we will do it in dark so that no one will see the other. Somehow, he convinced me. So, another chapter opened and first time, I was too nervous. Jiju guided me from my room to his in total darkness and he got me inside him. And took sister below him and we started fucking. This time, I was not needed to take care of his massive cock as sister had taken the task and gulped him. I was overcautious not to touch any part of her body. And somehow, finished first time though, I was over excited, as I had never seen any naked woman And I could visualize naked body sprawled just below me except jiju was in between us. This Had more effect on me may be on that couple also. The moment I climaxed I took out still erect Cock out of the hot and tight orifice with the pluck sound, and ran to my room without turning Back. Once I entered my room cleaned myself, fell on the cot and drifted off to sleep but in The middle of night my sleep was disturbed by wet dream of fucking some faceless woman and Kneading her boobs till she cried with pain and pleasure. I opened my eyes and myself alone On the bed and cock was erect looking at the ceiling. After many months, I felt like masturbating And I did. It was most powerful ejaculation of my life.<img src="/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Love" class="inlineimg"> <img src="/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt="" title="happy" class="inlineimg"> <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smile" class="inlineimg"> </i></font></font></font>

It repeated at least twice a week, probably other days they fucked each other in my absence. After few days of the new game once it so happened that in darkness my sister took my hand thinking that it was jijus and placed on her boobs as it was pitch dark as you know. I wanted just to pull out my hand from her boobs. In flash of a second I thought that, suppose if I pull back my hand, she will come to know her mistake and she will be embarrassed like hell. So, I continued to explore her boobs, pinched her areola, and played with her tits to my hearts content. When I increased the speed, I had to take off my hand and gripping jijus buttocks, I started banging heavily so jiju had to do nothing but to keep himself lined up to her choot and I did the rest of job. It was special night for me, and I started craving to hold tits in next coming episodes. This idea clicked I dont know when she felt three hands on her body and guessed what was going on. One day she asked me directly are you touching me daily, I did not pretend and accepted the fact and said how it started. She blushed but asked me a strange question, how did you felt them. I said wonderful and I want to see them in light. She just smiled and ran away from me that wish was also fulfilled. <img src="/images/smilies/love.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Love" class="inlineimg"> <img src="/images/smilie3/happy.gif" border="0" alt="" title="happy" class="inlineimg"> <img src="/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smile" class="inlineimg"> </i></font></font></font>
